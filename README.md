Command Checker and Installer

This Bash script allows users to check the availability of a specified command and, if necessary, attempts to install it. The script is designed for systems using the APT package manager, common in Debian-based Linux distributions.
Usage

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

Run the Script:

bash

    bash script.sh

    Follow the prompts to enter the command you want to check/install.

Requirements

    Bash
    APT package manager

Notes

    The script assumes the specified command is located in '/usr/bin/'.
    User input is required to provide the command name.
    If the command is not found, the script attempts to install it using APT.
